									<p>It all began with a whale-watching trip along the breathtaking California coast—an experience that ignited something deeper than wonder. While watching humpback whales surface in the wild, I spoke with a tour guide who explained the immense challenges scientists face in studying and protecting these majestic creatures. That conversation stayed with me. Fueled by curiosity and my passion for wildlife, I dove headfirst into the world of whale conservation—watching over 20 documentaries and reading "Whales and Nations" by Kurkpatrick Dorsey.</p>
									<p>As I dug deeper, one question kept returning: Why is it still so difficult to study these magnificent beings without disturbing them? That question, combined with my academic research in bio-inspired design, became the foundation of Whale Bot—a humane, energy-efficient tagging device inspired by the natural attachment mechanism of the remora fish.</p>
									<p>The urgency of this mission is real. On March 5, 2021, scientists and National Geographic filmmakers captured the first-ever full recording of a humpback whale giving birth—a breathtaking breakthrough after decades of effort, led by researcher Rachel Cartwright and the Keiki Kohola Project. Even more astonishing: to date, only two blue whale births have ever been documented in human history. Their rarity is not due to lack of effort, but to the immense difficulty of tracking and observing whales in remote ocean regions—especially during vulnerable life stages like birthing.</p>
                                    <p>This is where Whale Bot can make a difference.</p>
									<p>By designing a non-invasive, long-duration, self-powered device, Whale Bot aims to quietly stay with the whale for extended periods—recording behaviors, capturing rare events like births, and transmitting critical data, all without harming or disturbing its host. This could be a breakthrough in how we study, understand, and ultimately protect endangered species like the blue whale—before it's too late.</p>
